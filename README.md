This repository gathers machine learning challenges achieved


## Deep learning

### [Binary classification of images using CNN on Keras](https://github.com/Colin75/hackatons/blob/master/binary_class_vgg_face_keras.ipynb)
The goal of this work is to develop a binary classification model which detects if an image contains some -unknown- properties.  

### [Similiarity on encoded images using FC on Keras](https://github.com/Colin75/hackatons/blob/master/face_similarity_dense_keras.ipynb)
The goal of this study is to detect if 2 faces belong to the same person. Images are provided in encoded version. This is a binary classification problem.
